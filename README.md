# Assessment
Technology Used: .net core 6.0,SQL Server

Task 1: Building a Simple API
Create a basic API using ASP.NET Core that allows users to retrieve a list
of students. Use a hardcoded list of students for demonstration purposes.

Task 2: Basic Authentication
Enhance the API from Task 1 by adding basic authentication. Users should
be able to access the student list only after providing a username and
password.

Task 3: Database Integration with Entity Framework
Enhance the API from Task 2 to store and retrieve student data from a
database. Implement a single endpoint to retrieve the list of students
from the database.

Task 4: Asynchronous Programming
Refactor the API from Task 3 to use asynchronous programming for the
database operations. Update the database access methods to be
asynchronous.

Task 5: Error Handling
Implement basic error handling for the API. Create error responses for
scenarios such as invalid routes or database errors. Return appropriate
status codes and error messages
